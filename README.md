# Max's Adventure - A Python Game

This was a project made for a 2 semester course in Python object oriented programming at the university. It was my first time using Python.

I got so involved in this project that I ended up doing something beyond expected. The game uses pygame library as the rendering engine, and a self made pyshics engine to simulate gravity and object interations.

Here is a video showing the gameplay:

Here is a video showing some of the behind the scenes during the creation:
